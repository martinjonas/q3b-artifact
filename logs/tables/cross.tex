\caption{The table shows cross-comparison of solved benchmarks by all pairs of the solvers. Each cell shows the number of benchmarks that were solved by the solver in the corresponding row, but not by the solver by the corresponding column. The column \emph{Uniquely solved} shows the number of benchmarks that were solved only by the given solver.}
